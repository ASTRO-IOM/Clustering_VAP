# Clustering Van Allen Probe REPT Data
My PhD project entails applying a combination of machine learning techniques to relativitic electron flux measurements in order to classify pitch angle ditributions in the radition belts. In this technique we use a 2-stage dimensionality reduction by applying an autoencoder and principal component analysis to create a 3D representation of REPT data to use in clustering algorithms.
